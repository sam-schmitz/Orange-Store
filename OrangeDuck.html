    The orange duck is an illusive, and rare type of duck found only in the northern parts of
    Florida. They were accidently created in 1962 when a local factory spilled 250 thousand
    gallons of orange juice into local ponds. Since then they have been found all over the
    southern coast of the United States. Their primary food source is gummy worms and they
    are offten preyed upon by parched hunters.
