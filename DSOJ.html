<h2>Why You Shouldn't Spill Orange Juice</h2>
<hr />
<p>
  Some people have asked the question; Why Shouldn't you spill orange juice?
Orange juice is a liquid. Generally when liquids are on the ground, they are
easy to slip on. Also, once the orange juice drys on the ground, the ground
will become sticky. Therfore, you shouldn't spill orange juice.

<p>
  However, accidents happen. Somehow you might mitsakenly spill your orange
juice. If this happens you should grab either a paper towel or a towel to
wipe up the spiled juice.
